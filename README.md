Database Postgres

This is a simple time logger application that users can register, check in and out. A user may also edit their logged times. This is a work in progress and will eventually just be an API app. A front end application created in vue will be posted eventually on this github account. This application uses Trailblazer as a framework. For more information on trailblazer rails, visit https://github.com/trailblazer/trailblazer-rails.
